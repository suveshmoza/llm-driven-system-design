# Local Delivery Service - Development with Claude

## Project Context

This document tracks the development journey of implementing a last-mile delivery platform for local goods and services.

## Key Challenges to Explore

1. Real-time driver location
2. Efficient routing
3. Demand prediction
4. Multi-stop optimization

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements and Design
*Completed*

**Accomplishments:**
- Defined functional requirements (order placement, driver matching, real-time tracking, ratings)
- Established non-functional requirements (latency, scale, availability)
- Created detailed system design in system-design-answer-fullstack.md
- Designed database schema with PostgreSQL and Redis

### Phase 2: Initial Implementation
*In progress*

**Focus areas:**
- Implement core functionality
- Get something working end-to-end
- Validate basic assumptions

**Completed:**
- [x] Backend API with Express + TypeScript
- [x] PostgreSQL database schema with seed data
- [x] Redis integration for geo-indexing and pub/sub
- [x] WebSocket server for real-time updates
- [x] Authentication with session-based tokens
- [x] Driver location tracking with GEOADD/GEORADIUS
- [x] Driver matching with scoring algorithm
- [x] Order lifecycle management
- [x] Customer frontend with React + Tanstack Router
- [x] Driver dashboard with offer acceptance
- [x] Admin dashboard with stats
- [x] Docker Compose setup for PostgreSQL and Redis

**Remaining:**
- [ ] Fix bcrypt password hashing for demo accounts
- [ ] Add map visualization for driver tracking
- [ ] End-to-end testing

### Phase 3: Scaling and Optimization
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Add caching layer
- Optimize database queries
- Implement load balancing
- Add monitoring

### Phase 4: Polish and Documentation
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Complete documentation
- Add comprehensive tests
- Performance tuning
- Code cleanup

## Design Decisions Log

### 1. Redis for Geo-Indexing
**Decision:** Use Redis GEOADD/GEORADIUS for driver location tracking instead of PostgreSQL PostGIS.
**Rationale:** Redis provides sub-millisecond query times for nearby driver searches, essential for real-time matching. PostgreSQL PostGIS is more suitable for historical analysis.

### 2. Sequential Driver Offers
**Decision:** Offer orders to drivers sequentially rather than broadcasting to all nearby drivers.
**Rationale:** Sequential offers are fairer to drivers and avoid race conditions. Each driver gets 30 seconds to accept/reject.

### 3. WebSocket for Real-time Updates
**Decision:** Use native WebSocket instead of Socket.io.
**Rationale:** Simpler implementation, lower overhead, and sufficient for our use case. Redis Pub/Sub handles message distribution.

### 4. Session-based Authentication
**Decision:** Use session tokens stored in Redis instead of JWT.
**Rationale:** Simpler to implement and manage for a learning project. Sessions can be invalidated instantly.

### 5. Zustand for State Management
**Decision:** Use Zustand instead of Redux or Context API.
**Rationale:** Minimal boilerplate, easy to use, and sufficient for our state management needs.

## Iterations and Learnings

### Iteration 1: Initial Implementation
- Implemented full backend with all core services
- Created frontend with customer, driver, and admin interfaces
- Learned that Redis geo operations are very efficient for real-time location queries
- Driver matching algorithm needs tuning based on real usage patterns

## Questions and Discussions

### Open Questions
1. How to handle driver offline while carrying orders?
   - Current approach: Driver cannot go offline with active deliveries
   - Future: Add grace period and order reassignment

2. How to optimize multi-stop routes?
   - Current: Single-order focus
   - Future: Implement batching with TSP optimization

3. How to predict demand for driver positioning?
   - Not implemented yet
   - Future: ML model based on historical data
