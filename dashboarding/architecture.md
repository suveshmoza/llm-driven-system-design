# Dashboarding System - Metrics Monitoring and Visualization - Architecture Design

## System Overview

A metrics monitoring and visualization system similar to Datadog or Grafana for collecting, storing, and visualizing time-series data

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Metrics collection and ingestion
- Time-series data storage
- Real-time dashboards and visualization
- Alerting and notifications
- Query and aggregation engine
- Multiple data source support
- Custom dashboard creation
- Metric retention and downsampling

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Scalability: *To be defined*
- Availability: *To be defined*
- Latency: *To be defined*
- Consistency: *To be defined*

## Capacity Estimation

*To be calculated based on expected scale:*
