## Overview

A simplified Spotify-like platform demonstrating music streaming, playlist management, recommendation systems, and playback analytics. This educational project focuses on building a music streaming service with personalized discovery features.

## Key Features

### 1. Music Library
- Artists, albums, and tracks catalog
- Metadata management with cover art
- Search across all content types
- Browse by category

### 2. Streaming
- Audio streaming with HTML5 Audio
- Playback controls (play, pause, next, previous)
- Queue management with shuffle and repeat modes
- Volume control and mute

### 3. Playlists
- Create and manage playlists
- Add/remove tracks from playlists
- Liked Songs collection
- Playlist cover images

### 4. Recommendations
- Personalized "For You" recommendations
- Discover Weekly playlist
- Popular/trending tracks
- Similar tracks and artist radio

### 5. Library Management
- Liked songs, saved albums, followed artists
- Personal playlist collection
- Recently played tracks
- Listening history

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Vite, React 19, TanStack Router, Zustand, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (metadata, users, playlists)
- **Cache**: Redis (sessions, caching)
- **Object Storage**: MinIO (audio files, cover art)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose

### 1. Start Infrastructure

```bash
cd spotify
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts:
- PostgreSQL on port 5432
- Redis on port 6379
- MinIO on ports 9000 (API) and 9001 (Console)

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run seed    # Creates tables and seed data
npm run dev     # Starts server on port 3001
```

### 3. Setup Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev     # Starts on port 5173
```

### 4. Access the Application

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001/health
- **MinIO Console**: http://localhost:9001 (minioadmin/minioadmin)

## Environment Variables

### Backend

```bash
# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=spotify

## Key Technical Challenges

1. **Audio Streaming**: HTML5 Audio with signed URLs for access control
2. **Recommendations**: Simplified collaborative filtering based on listening history
3. **Real-time Updates**: Playback state sync with Redis
4. **Session Management**: Redis-backed sessions with Express
5. **Object Storage**: MinIO for audio files and album artwork
