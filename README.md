# LLM-Driven System Design Practice

## Vision

Traditional system design interview preparation often relies on passive learning - reading articles, watching YouTube videos, and memorizing architectural patterns. While valuable, this approach lacks the hands-on experience that comes from actually building systems.

This repository represents a different approach: **learning system design by actually implementing it**.

With the assistance of LLMs like Claude, we can rapidly prototype lightweight versions of classic (and creative) system design interview questions. This hands-on practice helps develop:

- **Architectural thinking** - Making real trade-offs, not theoretical ones
- **Implementation experience** - Understanding what actually works vs. what looks good on a whiteboard
- **Technology selection** - Choosing the right tools for each use case
- **Scalability patterns** - Building systems that can grow
- **Problem-solving skills** - Debugging and iterating on real implementations

## System Design Challenges

## Project Structure

Each project folder contains:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Implementation guide, setup instructions, and testing details |
| `architecture.md` | System design documentation, architectural decisions, and trade-offs |
| `system-design-answer.md` | Interview-style answer (45-minute format) |
| `claude.md` | LLM collaboration notes and iteration history |
| Source code | Actual implementation (varies by project) |

## Getting Started

1. Choose a system design challenge that interests you
2. Read the `architecture.md` to understand the design decisions
3. Follow the `README.md` for setup and implementation details
4. Review `claude.md` to see how the system evolved through LLM collaboration

## LLM-Assisted Development

This repository leverages Claude and other LLMs to:
- Rapidly prototype architectural ideas
- Generate boilerplate code and infrastructure
- Explore different implementation approaches
- Debug and optimize systems
- Document design decisions

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for guidelines on collaborating with AI on system design projects.

## Learning Approach

1. **Understand the requirements** - What problem are we solving?
2. **Design the architecture** - What components do we need?
3. **Identify key challenges** - What are the hard parts?
4. **Implement incrementally** - Start simple, add complexity
5. **Test and iterate** - Does it work? Can it scale?
6. **Reflect and document** - What did we learn?
