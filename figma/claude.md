# Figma - Collaborative Design and Prototyping Platform - Development with Claude

## Project Context

This document tracks the development journey of implementing a collaborative design and prototyping platform with real-time multiplayer editing.

## Key Challenges to Explore

1. Real-time collaborative editing (CRDT vs OT)
2. Vector graphics storage and rendering
3. Conflict resolution in concurrent edits
4. Version control and history management
5. Component and design system management
6. Performance with large design files

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements and Design
*Not started*

**Questions to explore:**
- What are the core vs. nice-to-have features?
- What scale are we targeting?
- What are the key technical constraints?

### Phase 2: Initial Implementation
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Implement core functionality
- Get something working end-to-end
- Validate basic assumptions

### Phase 3: Scaling and Optimization
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Add caching layer
- Optimize database queries
- Implement load balancing
- Add monitoring

### Phase 4: Polish and Documentation
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Complete documentation
- Add comprehensive tests
- Performance tuning
- Code cleanup
