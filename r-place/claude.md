# r/place - Collaborative Real-time Pixel Canvas - Development with Claude

## Project Context

This document tracks the development journey of implementing a collaborative real-time pixel art canvas where users can place colored pixels with rate limiting.

## Key Challenges to Explore

1. Real-time pixel synchronization across millions of users
2. Rate limiting at scale
3. Canvas state storage and persistence
4. Efficient broadcast of pixel updates
5. Canvas history and timelapse generation
6. Handling concurrent pixel placements

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements and Design
*Not started*

**Questions to explore:**
- What are the core vs. nice-to-have features?
- What scale are we targeting?
- What are the key technical constraints?

### Phase 2: Initial Implementation
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Implement core functionality
- Get something working end-to-end
- Validate basic assumptions

### Phase 3: Scaling and Optimization
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Add caching layer
- Optimize database queries
- Implement load balancing
- Add monitoring

### Phase 4: Polish and Documentation
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Complete documentation
- Add comprehensive tests
- Performance tuning
- Code cleanup
