## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- npm or yarn

### Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended)

1. **Start infrastructure services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This starts:
   - PostgreSQL with PostGIS on port 5432
   - Redis on port 6379
   - Elasticsearch on port 9200

2. **Wait for services to be healthy**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```
   All services should show as "healthy".

3. **Install and start the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Sync Elasticsearch index** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run sync-elasticsearch
   ```

5. **Install and start the frontend** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000
   - Health check: http://localhost:3000/health

### Option 2: Native Services Setup

If you prefer to run services natively:

#### PostgreSQL with PostGIS

```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install postgresql@16 postgis

# Start PostgreSQL
brew services start postgresql@16

# Create database
createdb yelp_db
psql yelp_db -c "CREATE USER yelp WITH PASSWORD 'yelp_password';"
psql yelp_db -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE yelp_db TO yelp;"
psql yelp_db -c "CREATE EXTENSION postgis;"
psql yelp_db -c "CREATE EXTENSION \"uuid-ossp\";"

# Run init script
psql yelp_db -f backend/db/init.sql
```

#### Redis

```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

#### Elasticsearch

```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew tap elastic/tap
brew install elastic/tap/elasticsearch-full
brew services start elasticsearch-full
```

### Environment Configuration

The backend uses a `.env` file for configuration. The default values work with Docker:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if using custom ports or credentials
```

### Running Multiple Server Instances

For testing distributed scenarios:

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd backend && npm run dev:server1  # Port 3001

# Terminal 2
cd backend && npm run dev:server2  # Port 3002

# Terminal 3
cd backend && npm run dev:server3  # Port 3003
```
