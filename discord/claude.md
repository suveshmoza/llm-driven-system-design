# Discord - Real-time Chat and Community Platform - Development with Claude

## Project Context

This document tracks the development journey of implementing a real-time chat and community platform with voice/video capabilities, channels, and servers.

## Key Challenges to Explore

1. Real-time message delivery at scale
2. Voice and video chat infrastructure
3. Server and channel organization
4. User presence tracking
5. Message persistence and history
6. Permissions and role management

## Development Phases
