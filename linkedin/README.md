## Overview

A simplified LinkedIn-like platform demonstrating professional social graphs, connection recommendations, feed ranking, and job matching algorithms. This educational project focuses on building a professional networking system with sophisticated recommendation engines.

## Key Features

### 1. Professional Profiles
- Work history and education
- Skills and endorsements
- Profile completeness scoring

### 2. Connection Graph
- First, second, third-degree connections
- Connection requests and acceptance
- Mutual connections display
- "People You May Know" (PYMK) recommendations

### 3. Feed & Content
- Professional posts with rich content
- Engagement (likes, comments)
- Feed ranking algorithm based on engagement, recency, and relationship

### 4. Job Matching
- Job listings with requirements and salary ranges
- Candidate-job matching score based on skills, experience, location
- Application tracking
- Recommended jobs for users

### 5. Company Pages
- Company profiles with industry and size
- Job postings per company

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** TypeScript + Vite + React 19 + TanStack Router + Zustand + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Cache:** Redis
- **Search:** Elasticsearch
- **Containerization:** Docker Compose

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- npm or yarn

### 1. Start Infrastructure

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for services to be healthy (about 30 seconds)
docker-compose ps
```

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Seed the database with test data
npm run seed

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The backend will be available at http://localhost:3001

### 3. Setup Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173

## Development Notes

### Running Multiple Backend Instances

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev:server1  # Port 3001

# Terminal 2
npm run dev:server2  # Port 3002

# Terminal 3
npm run dev:server3  # Port 3003
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
# Database
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=linkedin
DB_USER=linkedin
DB_PASSWORD=linkedin_password

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Elasticsearch
ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200

# Session
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

## Key Technical Challenges

1. **Connection Degrees**: Efficiently computing 2nd and 3rd degree connections using recursive CTEs
2. **People You May Know**: Multi-factor scoring based on mutual connections, shared companies, schools, skills, and location
3. **Feed Ranking**: Balancing recency, relevance (connection degree), and engagement signals
4. **Job Matching**: Multi-factor scoring based on skill match, experience level, location, and company connections
