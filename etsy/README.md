## Overview

A simplified Etsy-like platform demonstrating seller marketplace dynamics, search relevance, personalization, and handmade/vintage product discovery. This educational project focuses on building a multi-seller e-commerce platform with emphasis on unique product discovery.

## Key Features

### 1. Seller Shops
- Shop setup and branding
- Product listings
- Inventory management
- Order fulfillment

### 2. Product Discovery
- Category browsing
- Full-text search with Elasticsearch
- Synonym-enhanced search for handmade items
- Trending and popular items

### 3. Personalization
- Favorite shops and items
- View history tracking
- Similar product recommendations

### 4. Buyer Experience
- Shopping cart (multi-seller)
- Checkout with orders split by seller
- Order tracking per seller
- Reviews and favorites

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Vite, React 19, TanStack Router, Zustand, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache/Sessions**: Redis
- **Search**: Elasticsearch

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- npm or yarn

### 1. Start Infrastructure

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch
docker-compose up -d

# Wait for services to be healthy (especially Elasticsearch)
docker-compose ps
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate

# Seed with sample data
npm run seed

# Start the backend server
npm run dev
```

The backend runs on http://localhost:3000

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend dev server
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on http://localhost:5173

## Test Accounts

After running the seed script, these accounts are available:

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| buyer@example.com | password123 | Buyer |
| alice@example.com | password123 | Seller (Alice's Handmade Jewelry) |
| bob@example.com | password123 | Seller (Bob's Woodwork Studio) |
| carol@example.com | password123 | Seller (Carol's Vintage Finds) |
| admin@example.com | admin123 | Admin |

## Running Multiple Backend Instances

For testing load balancing and distributed scenarios:

```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev:server1  # Port 3001

# Terminal 2
npm run dev:server2  # Port 3002

# Terminal 3
npm run dev:server3  # Port 3003
```

## Key Technical Challenges Addressed

### 1. Multi-Seller Cart
Cart items are grouped by shop, and checkout creates separate orders per seller with independent fulfillment tracking.

### 2. Search Relevance
Elasticsearch with synonym filters handles varied terminology (handmade, handcrafted, artisan) and fuzzy matching for typos.

### 3. One-of-a-Kind Inventory
Products often have quantity=1. Short cart reservations (15 min) prevent overselling unique items.

### 4. Sparse Signal Personalization
Recommendations based on favorites and view history, with trending products for cold-start users.
