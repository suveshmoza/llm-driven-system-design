# LLM-Driven System Design Practice

## 🎯 Vision

Traditional system design interview preparation often relies on passive learning - reading articles, watching YouTube videos, and memorizing architectural patterns. While valuable, this approach lacks the hands-on experience that comes from actually building systems.

This repository represents a different approach: **learning system design by actually implementing it**.

With the assistance of LLMs like Claude, we can rapidly prototype lightweight versions of classic (and creative) system design interview questions. This hands-on practice helps develop:

- **Architectural thinking** - Making real trade-offs, not theoretical ones
- **Implementation experience** - Understanding what actually works vs. what looks good on a whiteboard
- **Technology selection** - Choosing the right tools for each use case
- **Scalability patterns** - Building systems that can grow
- **Problem-solving skills** - Debugging and iterating on real implementations

## 🏗️ Project Structure

Each project folder contains:

- **README.md** - Implementation guide, setup instructions, and testing details
- **architecture.md** - System design documentation, architectural decisions, and trade-offs
- **claude.md** - Collaboration notes, LLM-assisted development insights, and iteration history
- **Source code** - Actual implementation (varies by project)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Choose a system design challenge that interests you
2. Read the `architecture.md` to understand the design decisions
3. Follow the `README.md` for setup and implementation details
4. Review `claude.md` to see how the system evolved through LLM collaboration

## 🤖 LLM-Assisted Development

This repository leverages Claude and other LLMs to:
- Rapidly prototype architectural ideas
- Generate boilerplate code and infrastructure
- Explore different implementation approaches
- Debug and optimize systems
- Document design decisions

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for guidelines on collaborating with AI on system design projects.

## 📖 Learning Approach

1. **Understand the requirements** - What problem are we solving?
2. **Design the architecture** - What components do we need?
3. **Identify key challenges** - What are the hard parts?
4. **Implement incrementally** - Start simple, add complexity
5. **Test and iterate** - Does it work? Can it scale?
6. **Reflect and document** - What did we learn?

## 🎓 Skills Developed

- Distributed systems design
- Database schema design and optimization
- API design and versioning
- Caching strategies
- Load balancing and horizontal scaling
- Real-time data processing
- Message queues and event-driven architecture
- Security and authentication
- Monitoring and observability
