# Dashboarding System - Metrics Monitoring and Visualization - Development with Claude

## Project Context

This document tracks the development journey of implementing a metrics monitoring and visualization system similar to Datadog or Grafana for collecting, storing, and visualizing time-series data.

## Key Challenges to Explore

1. Time-series data storage and retrieval at scale
2. High-throughput metrics ingestion
3. Efficient aggregation and downsampling
4. Real-time dashboard updates
5. Alert evaluation and notification
6. Query optimization for large time ranges
7. Data retention and storage efficiency

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements and Design
*Not started*

**Questions to explore:**
- What are the core vs. nice-to-have features?
- What scale are we targeting?
- What are the key technical constraints?

### Phase 2: Initial Implementation
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Implement core functionality
- Get something working end-to-end
- Validate basic assumptions

### Phase 3: Scaling and Optimization
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Add caching layer
- Optimize database queries
- Implement load balancing
- Add monitoring

### Phase 4: Polish and Documentation
*Not started*

**Focus areas:**
- Complete documentation
- Add comprehensive tests
- Performance tuning
- Code cleanup
