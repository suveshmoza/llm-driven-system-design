# r/place - Collaborative Real-time Pixel Canvas - Architecture Design

## System Overview

A collaborative real-time pixel art canvas where users can place colored pixels with rate limiting

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Shared pixel canvas
- Real-time pixel placement
- Rate limiting per user
- Live canvas updates
- Canvas history and timelapse
- Collaborative art creation

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Scalability: *To be defined*
- Availability: *To be defined*
- Latency: *To be defined*
- Consistency: *To be defined*

## Capacity Estimation

*To be calculated based on expected scale:*
