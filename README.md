# LLM-Driven System Design Practice

## 🎯 Vision

Traditional system design interview preparation often relies on passive learning - reading articles, watching YouTube videos, and memorizing architectural patterns. While valuable, this approach lacks the hands-on experience that comes from actually building systems.

This repository represents a different approach: **learning system design by actually implementing it**.

With the assistance of LLMs like Claude, we can rapidly prototype lightweight versions of classic (and creative) system design interview questions. This hands-on practice helps develop:

- **Architectural thinking** - Making real trade-offs, not theoretical ones
- **Implementation experience** - Understanding what actually works vs. what looks good on a whiteboard
- **Technology selection** - Choosing the right tools for each use case
- **Scalability patterns** - Building systems that can grow
- **Problem-solving skills** - Debugging and iterating on real implementations
