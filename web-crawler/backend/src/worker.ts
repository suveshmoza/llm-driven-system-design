/**
 * @fileoverview Crawler worker entry point.
 *
 * This is the entry point for running a crawler worker process.
 * Each worker runs independently and processes URLs from the shared frontier.
 * Multiple workers can run in parallel for horizontal scaling.
 *
 * A worker:
 * - Initializes database connections
 * - Creates and starts a CrawlerService instance
 * - Handles graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT
 *
 * Usage:
 *   WORKER_ID=1 npm run dev:worker
 *   WORKER_ID=2 npm run dev:worker
 *
 * @module worker
